# 🎓 Second Year Projects

This folder contains all coursework and programming projects completed during my second year at **Belgium Campus ITversity**.

## 📚 Overview

These projects focus on solving real-world problems using more advanced programming techniques and technologies introduced during the second year. Key areas include:

- Object-Oriented Programming with C# (.NET)
- Web Programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- SQL and Database Management with SSMS
- Event-Driven Programming
- Threading and Exception Handling

## 📂 Projects

Each subfolder represents a specific assignment or module project. Highlights include:

- **WPR281_Project** – A Web Programming project demonstrating frontend skills and page design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **PRG2781_Project** – A C# console application using object-oriented principles, multithreading, events, and exception handling.
- **DBD281_Project** – A Database Management project using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**. This project focuses on database design, query writing, stored procedures, and normalization.

*(More projects will be added as the year progresses.)*

## 🎯 Purpose

These projects reflect the growing complexity and depth of software development skills acquired during second-year studies. They demonstrate the ability to design, implement, and document solutions that are both functional and maintainable.
