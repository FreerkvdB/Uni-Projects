# 🎓 University Coding Projects

Welcome to my repository for programming coursework completed at **Belgium Campus ITversity**. This repo contains structured folders by academic year, showcasing practical projects in multiple programming languages and technologies.

## 📚 About

This repository serves as a portfolio of my learning journey across different modules, including:

- C# and .NET Framework (Console Applications, Windows Forms, and ADO.NET)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend Development)
- SQL and SSMS (Database Development)
- Microsoft Access (Database Management)

Each folder is organized by academic year and includes Zip folders of all projects available for download, where applicable.

## 🔧 How to Run

Most C# projects are .NET Console Applications. To run them:

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**
2. Restore NuGet packages if needed
3. Build and run

HTML/CSS/JS projects can be opened directly in a browser.

SQL scripts are designed for **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
